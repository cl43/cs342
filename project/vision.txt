Vision Statement

       For my project, I would like to design a database for a vegetable delivery company. The tables would include a 
list of veggies in stock, employees, customers, vehicles, shipments, and loans from the boss to employees. My potential 
user is my own father as this vegetable company is actually based on his very own small company in Detroit, therefore I 
believe the database can be applicable even outside of class.

	The database would also have procedures to deduct and increase the amount of items in the stockhold of the company,
along with contain safety measures (triggers) to avoid having an impossible situation happen like a delivery being assigned
to a broken vehicle. That way the project may actually have an outside-of-class functionality.

I also hope to make a web server on this database which would allow users to modify orders and other database values off the
website that glassfish would provide.

1. The sample data that I put in for data.sql is based on real-life examples of my father's vegetable company.
However, due to me not knowing all of the details of how the company runs, some of the inputs such as lastname
on employees,customer addresses, etc. For those, I simply made up those values. Attributes that I would know
such as firstName on employees is true to the most part. I have added many more entries due to the amount I had
last time, not being enough. For those additional entries, they're all made up for the sake of filling up the data.

2. I chose 4NF to be the normal form for this schema. Not only is it a very desirable normal form to aim for,
but it is also simple to implement, and best matches the structures of my tables. I believe my tables do not
contain and trivial FDs which already achieves BCNF. After that, there is no multi-valued dependencies with the
left-hand sides being super-keys for the most part which is why I believe it fits under the criteria of 4NF.

3.  Non-Trivial FD:

    Super keys have parenthesis:

    (Employee.ID) -> FName, LName, Position, Paycheck
    (Customer.ID) -> Name, Address, City, Zip
    (Loan.ID) -> Amount, createDate, dueDate, Paid
    (Order.ID) -> orderDate, deliverDate, Price
    (Vehicle.ID) -> Model, Condition
    (Item.ID) -> Name, Price, Stock

Due to the FDs not being subsets of their own determinant and no MVD's, it is safe to say that the schema fits the 4NF form.

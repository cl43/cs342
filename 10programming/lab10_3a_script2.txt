SELECT rank FROM Movie
WHERE id = 238071;

UPDATE Movie
SET rank = rank - 0.1
WHERE id = 238071;

8.6 is still the rank we are given after running this script. It is probably because script 1
has already put its update into effect, leaving rank at 8.7, therefore when we subtract is by 8.7
you would still get 8.6. The second script doesnt seem to be all that different, probably because it
is simply subtracting. It seems commit just puts the Isolation of the ACID properties into effect.

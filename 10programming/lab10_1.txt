10.1.a

Oracle indeed does handle the transaction life-cycle to starting an stoppind sql sessions.
Oracle sessions will not see the effects of other on-going sessions until a commit or rollback
has been committed.

10.1.b

Atomicity can probably be done with commands such as commit and rollback as they often are all or nothing commands.
Consistency would not be done by commands themselves, but more by the DBMS instead.
Isolation would be more difficult as commits and rollbacks tend to have effects on other on-going sessions within sql.
Durability would be handled by the DBMS as well.

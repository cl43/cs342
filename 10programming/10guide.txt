1a. Interleaving - Takes turns on processes, pausing one to resume the other and keeping them in equal progress
    Parallel - Runs all processes simulatenously if possible

 b. Lost Update - When two transactions that access the same DB item have their operations interleaved so that some DB values are incorrect
    Dirty Read - When a transaction updates a DB item and then the transaction fails for given reason.

 c. Transaction - An atomic unit of work that should either be completed in its entirety or not done at all.
    Commits - When all operations to access a DB are successful and are logged.
    Rollback - Search for all transactions that are logged, but have not written their commit record yet.

 d. Atomicity - Transaction should be performed in its entirety or not at all.
    Consistency preservation - If a transaction is completed with no interference, then it should take the database from one consistent state to another.
    Isolation - A transaction should appear as if it is insolated to other transaction executions.
    Durability - The changes to a DB by a transaction must persist.

 e. Schedule - Ordering of the operations of the transaction.

2a. Lock - A variable associated with a data item that describes the status of the item with respect to possible operations that can be applied to it.

 b. Two-phase locking - If all locking operations precede the first unlock operation in a transaction.

3a. Savepoint - Names and marks the current point in the processing of a transaction.
    Commit - Ends the current transaction and makes any changes permanent.
    Rollback - Ends the current transaction and undoes any changes made.

 b. Lock Table - lock an entired database table so that you can share or deny access.
    For Update - identifies the rows that will be updated or deleted and then locks each row in the result set.

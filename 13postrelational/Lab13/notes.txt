13.1.
     a.
	Store.put(key, value) - creates a key and stores a value with it.
	EM.persist() - Makes an instance managed and persistent.
     b.
	Store.put() stores a key and value pair in KVLite DB. myHashTable.put() places the key and value in a hash table.

13.2.
     a.
	KVLite Keys support one-to-many in terms of relationships with other entities.
	Relational database can one-to-many and perform many-to-many which KVLite cannot do without much difficulty.

13.3.
     a.
	In order for a key-value database to implement the one-to-many(n) join, the key must be reimplemented for how many times n causes the
	key to join. This would result in much redundant information, very much like the PersonTeam table earlier in the course.
     b.
	If a person desires to have a key created but has no current use for it, then they may create an empty value. The value may alleviate some
	memory used because the key doesn't actually store anything. It is similar to calling an instance variable, but not yet assigning any value
	to it.

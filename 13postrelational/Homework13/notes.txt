2.a. KvLite is a NOSQL database system that is based on key/value data model.
  b. I would user the Column Family stores. It is the most similar to the Relational database model which is what mySQL is created with in mind.
  c. It should be doable. You would have to reverse the keystructure to grab movies that are affiliated with the actor. It would take much longer to do however
     as a movie probably has less actors, then all of the movies that a given actor has starred in.
  d. There isn't a schema for this at all. There is no table or relationships like the usual Oracle SQL. You simply create keys and apply a value to it.

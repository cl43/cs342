1a. I believe this table is in 1NF. None of the attributes seem to be designed for carrying multiple values. Potentially
Author_name may be able to but it is most likely designed for simply a first name as there is no implication for holding
a value for the last name as well. Because it is not in BCNF, it cannot be in 4NF. The FD's left hand sides are not all
super keys, therefore it is not in BCNF.

1b.
Book(Book_title, Author_name, Book_type, List_Price, Author_affil, Publisher)

FDs:
Book_title -> Publisher, Book_type
Book_type -> List_price
Author_name -> Author_affil


Lets say our target is to make this schema become BCNF. None of the FDs are trivial, but not alll are super keys as well.
To fix that, we would have to make additional tables to make each left-hand side a super-key. The following FD left-hand
sides are Book_title, Book_type, and Author_name.

Author_Name is super-key here. The table carries all of Author-relevant attributes.
Author(Author_name,Author_affil);

Book_title is super-key here. The table carries all book-relevant attr.
Book(Book_title,Book_type,,Publisher);

This is separated into another table in order to make the book_type a super-key, List price is included since it is dependant.
Booktype(Book_type,List_Price);

Breaking down to these three tables should bring the schema to BCNF.

2a. The potential candidate keys are:
Book_Name,Author,Edition,Copyright_Year
Book_Name,Author,Edition
Book_Name,Author,Copyright_Year

2b. Whenever an attribute has another value such as Author containing Navanthe and Elmasri, the values of edition and year are
repeated for every author that was a part of the book.

2c. 
Book(ID,Book_Name,Edition,Copyright_Year)
Author(ID,Author_Name)
BookAuthor(BookID,AuthorID)

FD:
Book(ID->Book_Name,Edition,Copyright_Year)
Author(ID->Author_Name)

The schema is in BCNF due to non-trivial FDs and left-hand sides are super-keys. It also has no MVDs so it is in 4NF as well.
